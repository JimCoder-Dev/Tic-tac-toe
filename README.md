## Overview

Tic Tac Toe

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- TO DO
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- DONE
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.grid-3-col {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 140px);
  grid-gap: 1rem;
}
```

```js
function checkVertical(gamePiece) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (
      gameCheckBoard[i] === gamePiece &&
      gameCheckBoard[i + 3] === gamePiece &&
      gameCheckBoard[i + 6] === gamePiece
    ) {
      return true;
    }
  }
}
```
